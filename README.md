Harvard CS50P coursework – 10 weeks of Python programming practice

This repo contains my solutions to all problem sets from [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/), Harvard’s free course on programming with Python.

I'm completing the full course in one week as part of my journey to land a summer SWE internship. All work is written, tested, and pushed manually to GitHub as I go.
